1. What tools and approaches do you use for performance or load testing of applications?
2. What are microservices, and what considerations are important when testing a microservices-based application?
3. Explain continuous integration (CI) and why it is important in automated testing workflows.
4. How would you design a scalable automation test framework for a large web application?
5. How do you identify the root cause of a defect uncovered during testing? (Describe your debugging approach.)
6. How do you locate and interact with dynamic web elements (elements with changing identifiers) in Selenium?
7. How would you automate REST API testing in your framework? (For example, testing HTTP endpoints with expected status codes and payloads.)
8. What strategies would you use to handle flaky or nondeterministic tests in your automation suite?
9. What are the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP)?
10. Write a function to reverse a singly-linked list (for example, 1→2→3→null becomes null←3←2←1).
11. Given an array of size N–1 containing numbers 1..N with one missing, find the missing number.
12. Given the head of a singly-linked list, write a function to detect whether it contains a cycle (e.g., using Floyd’s cycle detection).
