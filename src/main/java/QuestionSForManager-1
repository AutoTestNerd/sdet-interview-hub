Q1: how you set objectives for team members?
Answer : Setting clear and impactful objective for my team has always been priority.i believe in allinging team goal with
        both indvidual and compnay's objective to ensure mutual growth.

         The objectives I typically set were centered around key areas like:
         1. Improve Test Automation Coverage and Efficiency:
            goals:  Achieve 90% test automation coverage for critical applications and reduce testing time by 30%.

         2. Improve Product Stability and Early Defect Detection
           goals:  Reduce the number of post-release defects by 40% through proactive testing and early detection.

         3. Reduce Time-to-Market by Improving Test Cycle Time
            Goals: Cut the overall test cycle time by 25% to support faster product releases and better time-to-market.

         4. Improve Collaboration Between QA, Development, and Product Teams
            Gaols:Foster a more collaborative approach to quality across engineering, development, and product teams.

         5. Scale Infrastructure for Future Growth
            Goal: Scale the infrastructure to handle increased traffic and new product launches over the next 12 months.


       Q2:How do you do performance Managment?

       Answer-  Performance management for me is about aligning individual and team goals with organizational objectives.
                1. I set clear, measurable goals for each team member, focusing on both personal and team development.
                   I might set specific targets like increasing test coverage by 20% or reducing regression cycle times by 30%.
                2.Provide Regular Feedback:
                       I believe in continuous feedback. I give both positive reinforcement when things are going
                       well and constructive feedback when improvements are needed. I conduct regular one-on-one
                        meetings with team members to understand their challenges, provide feedback, and offer support.
                        These conversations are open, two-way dialogues that help me get a sense of their job satisfaction and development needs.
                3. I measure performance against specific KPIs (e.g., test coverage, defect density, automation efficiency, response times).
                     These KPIs help us identify areas of strength and areas needing improvement.
                4. Encourage Development and Growth: I support my team members’ development by helping them identify opportunities for growth,
                   such as attending relevant training, learning new technologies, or taking on new responsibilities.
                5. Recognize and Reward Achievements-I make sure to acknowledge and celebrate individual and team accomplishments,
                  whether it’s through public recognition, rewards, or providing growth opportunities.
                6.At the end of each performance cycle (typically quarterly or annually), I conduct formal performance
                  reviews. During this process, we review progress against goals, discuss successes, and identify areas for improvement.

      3. How to manage their skillset and upskilling?
                  I start by assessing each team member’s current skills through project work, one-on-one discussions,
                  and performance reviews. Based on this, I identify skill gaps and align them with upcoming project needs
                  and individual growth goals. I encourage certifications, hands-on learning,
                  and pair programming for real-time skill transfer. We also schedule regular knowledge-sharing sessions
                  within the team. I introduce new tools or frameworks gradually and ensure team members have the time and
                  support to explore them. I collaborate with HR or L&D teams to nominate individuals for relevant external training.
                   For leadership growth, I assign stretch responsibilities or mentor roles.


       4. How do you manage their progression in their career?

                 I manage QA engineers’ career progression by first identifying their strengths—manual testing, automation, mobile,
                  API, or leadership—and aligning their growth path accordingly. I have regular 1:1s to understand their goals,
                  like becoming a lead, a full-stack QA, or a domain specialist. Based on that,
                  I assign them stretch tasks like owning automation frameworks, driving CI/CD testing, leading sprint quality,
                   or mentoring junior QAs. I also encourage certifications in tools like Appium, Selenium, o
                    performance testing tools. Progress is tracked through skill development, delivery impact, and ownership.
                    I actively support promotions when milestones are met.
                 My goal is to make sure they grow technically and strategically as quality leaders.


       5  How I resolve conflicts between QA and other teams:
          ans :I resolve conflicts by understanding the real problem, focusing teams on common goals, not individual opinions, improving collaboration,
           and building  a culture of shared responsibility for quality."
           I use data (like defect leakage metrics, rework rates) to drive objective discussions
