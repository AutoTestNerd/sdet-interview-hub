üîç How click() Works Internally in Selenium WebDriver (Java)
         You call:

        WebElement button = driver.findElement(By.id("submitButton"));
        button.click();
        üß© Step-by-Step Breakdown of click() Internally
        1. Interface Method: WebElement
        The click() method is declared in the WebElement interface:

        public interface WebElement {
            void click();
        }
        This is the method signature you'll call in your test code.

        2. Concrete Implementation in RemoteWebElement
        RemoteWebElement implements WebElement and provides the actual implementation of click().

        // org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebElement

        @Override
        public void click() {
            execute("clickElement", ImmutableMap.of());
        }
        When you call click(), it internally calls the execute() method with the "clickElement" command and no additional parameters.

        3. Command Execution in execute()
        The execute() method is inherited from RemoteWebElement and sends the command to the remote WebDriver server:

        protected Response execute(String command, Map<String, ?> parameters) {
            Command cmd = new Command(sessionId, command, parameters);
            Response response = executor.execute(cmd);
            return response;
        }
        sessionId is the WebDriver session identifier.

        command is the name of the action (in this case, "clickElement").

        parameters are additional command arguments (none in this case).

        The execute() method sends the command to the CommandExecutor.

        4. HttpCommandExecutor and HTTP Request
        The HttpCommandExecutor class is responsible for sending the HTTP request to the browser driver (e.g., chromedriver):

        public class HttpCommandExecutor implements CommandExecutor {
            public Response execute(Command command) throws IOException {
                // Send the command as an HTTP request to the WebDriver server
            }
        }
        It sends a request like:

        POST /session/:sessionId/element/:elementId/click
        sessionId is the WebDriver session ID.

        elementId is the ID of the element that you want to click.

        5. Remote Browser Driver (e.g., ChromeDriver)
        Once the browser driver (like chromedriver) receives the request, it performs the click action in the browser using native commands.

        For example, in the case of Chrome:

        The chromedriver translates the command into a series of JavaScript commands that are executed in the browser's context:

        var element = document.querySelector('#submitButton');
        element.click();
        It ensures that the click happens only if the element is visible and interactable (i.e., not hidden, not disabled).

        6. Response Handling
        The browser driver returns a response to the HttpCommandExecutor, indicating whether the click was successful.

        If successful, the response typically contains a status of 0 (success).

        If the click fails (e.g., element is not interactable), it sends an error message.

        7. Returning to Test Script
        Finally, the result (success or failure) is sent back to the RemoteWebElement class and returned to the test script.
