Summary of the Flow
Driver.get("amazon.com") is called on a WebDriver object.

WebDriver.get() invokes the get(String url) method, defined in the WebDriver interface.

If using a Remote WebDriver, it calls RemoteWebDriver.get().

RemoteWebDriver sends a request to the remote server using WebDriverCommandExecutor.

The ChromeDriver or other browser-specific driver executes the navigation on the browser using browser automation protocols.

The browser loads the requested URL (amazon.com) and returns the page source to WebDriver.

Classes Involved
WebDriver (interface) → RemoteWebDriver (class) → WebDriverCommandExecutor (class) → Browser-Specific Driver (e.g., ChromeDriver)

Methods Involved:

get(String url) in WebDriver → RemoteWebDriver.get() → Browser-Specific Driver → Browser Command Execution

Key Interfaces and Classes:
WebDriver (Interface)

RemoteWebDriver (Class, implements WebDriver)

WebDriverCommandExecutor (Class)

ChromeDriver (Class, implements WebDriver)

DevTools Protocol or WebDriver Protocol (used for communication with the browser)

This is a high-level flow of how the driver.get() works when navigating to a URL in Selenium.
