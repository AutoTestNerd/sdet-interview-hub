Q : Detailed Selenium WebDriver Architecture with Diagram.
    Ans :
     Selenium WebDriver is an open-source tool for automating web applications across different browsers.
     Its architecture follows a client-server model, where the client sends commands to the server
     (i.e., the browser) to perform specific actions. The communication between the client and the server
      is standardized using either the W3C WebDriver protocol or the JSON Wire Protocol (older versions).

      Components of Selenium WebDriver Architecture:
        Selenium Client Libraries (Language Bindings):
                    Selenium provides bindings for multiple programming languages,including Java, Python,
                    C#, Ruby, and JavaScript.The test scripts are written using these libraries,
                    which internally communicate with the WebDriver API to interact with the browser.
        WebDriver API:
                    The WebDriver API provides a high-level interface to issue commands to the browser.
                    This API defines methods like .click(), .sendKeys(), .get(), etc.
                    It abstracts the browser-specific details, providing a uniform way of interacting with
                    all supported browsers.
        W3C WebDriver Protocol:
                    The W3C WebDriver Protocol is the newer standard (adopted in Selenium 4) for browser automation.
                     It eliminates inconsistencies across different browser drivers and allows WebDriver to
                     communicate directly with browsers using HTTP-based communication.
                      In older versions of Selenium, this communication was handled via the
                     JSON Wire Protocol. The W3C standard improves performance and cross-browser compatibility.
        Browser-Specific Drivers:
                    These are the browser-specific implementations of the WebDriver API. Each browser has its own driver, such as:
                        ChromeDriver (for Google Chrome)
                        GeckoDriver (for Mozilla Firefox)
                        IEDriverServer (for Internet Explorer)
                        Microsoft Edge Driver (for Microsoft Edge)
                        SafariDriver (for Safari)
                    These drivers act as a bridge between the Selenium commands (WebDriver API) and the actual browser.
                    They receive HTTP requests (commands) from the WebDriver
                    API and convert them into browser-specific actions.

        Browsers:
                    These are the actual browsers where the tests are executed. WebDriver controls browsers like
                    Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer.
                    The browser receives commands from the browser driver and performs actions like navigating to
                    a URL, clicking elements, or fetching page content
