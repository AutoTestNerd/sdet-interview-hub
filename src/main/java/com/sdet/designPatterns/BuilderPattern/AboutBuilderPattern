Q: What is builder Pattern
    its a creation design pattern that helps in constructing complex objects step by step.
    It separates object construction from its representation, allowing us to create different
    types of objects using the same building process


    Where to use:
    1. we have to pass many arguments to create Object.
    2. Some parameters might be optional.

 2.  Why Use the Builder Pattern?
    ✅ Avoids long constructors – Instead of passing multiple parameters to a constructor, we use a builder to set values one by one.
    ✅ Improves readability – The code is easier to understand and use.
    ✅ Encapsulates object creation – The object is constructed in a controlled manner.
    ✅ Supports immutability – The final object is immutable since it’s built step by step and then finalized


 3. How to implement Builder Patter in Automation Framework?
