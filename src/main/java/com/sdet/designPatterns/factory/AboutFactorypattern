Q1 : What is factory Design Pattern?

      Factory Design pattern is creational design pattern that provides a way to
      create object without exposing  the instantiation logic to the client,Instead of using creation with new keyword
      the Factory Method handles object creation.

        The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
        but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

      Advantage:
      Improved Code Readability and Reusability
      Centralizing object creation logic makes the code clean
      The same Factory.0 method can be used in multiple places.
