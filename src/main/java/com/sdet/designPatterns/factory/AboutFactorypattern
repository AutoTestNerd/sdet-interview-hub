Q1 : What is factory Design Pattern?

      Factory Design pattern is creation design pattern that provides a way to
      create object without exposing  the instantiation logic to the client,Instead of using creation with new keyword
      the Factory Method handles object creation.

      Advantage:
      Improved Code Readability and Reusability
      Centralizing object creation logic makes the code clean
      The same Factory method can be used in multiple places.
