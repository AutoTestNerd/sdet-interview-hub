Q: WHy should i hire you?
You should hire me because I bring a strong combination of technical expertise, leadership, and a quality-first
 mindset that aligns directly with the goals of this role. I have successfully led and built scalable automation
 frameworks using tools like Selenium, RestAssured, and TestNG, fully integrated with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins
  and Git.

Beyond automation, I have managed end-to-end quality strategies, mentored QA teams, and collaborated
cross-functionally with developers and DevOps to ensure faster, more reliable releases. I understand modern
 architectures like microservices and cloud environments, which positions me well to improve test coverage,
  performance, and release confidence in complex systems.

My focus is not just on finding bugs, but on building systems that prevent them,
using efficient test design, shift-left practices, and continuous feedback loops.
If you're looking for someone who combines hands-on technical depth with strategic thinking to
 elevate quality at scale, Iâ€™m confident I can deliver strong value to your team."
