Q1: Handling a situation where a high-performing team member doesn’t agree with feedback.
   Ans : , I approach the conversation with empathy and a focus on understanding their perspective. Here’s how I handle it:
           1. Understanding Their Perspective :
                    instead of pushing back , i took time to understand the view.
                    exm: I had a senior SDET who was highly skilled in automation and had consistently delivered high-quality
                        test scripts. However, during one of our releases, I provided feedback that the testing approach he used was too focused on speed and not enough on long-term maintainability. He was not in agreement with this,
                      as he believed that the immediate goal of meeting deadlines took precedence over the long-term vision."
           2.  Aligning with Team Goals:
                    I then reframed the feedback, aligning it with our broader goals. I explained how quickly developed automation
                    scripts could lead to brittle tests that would eventually slow us down, and ultimately impact our release cycle.
           3.  Collaborative Problem-Solving:
               We then collaborated on a solution. I suggested we could improve our testing process by incorporating early
                code reviews, paired programming, and test-driven development practices,
                which would allow us to maintain both speed and quality.
           4.  Ongoing Support and Follow-Up:


                "After we implemented the solution, I followed up regularly to ensure that the team member felt supported

   Q2: How do you ensure quality when scaling up the team or testing scope?
          When scaling, I focus on process, documentation, and mentorship. For example, when we onboarded 5 new engineers
            during a product expansion, I created onboarding guides, assigned mentors, and standardized test case templates and automation code reviews.

   Q3:  How I Motivate My QA/SDET Team
       “Motivating my team starts with creating a culture of ownership, recognition, and growth.
        I use a mix of strategic and people-focused methods to keep them engaged, aligned, and challenged.”

        1. Connect Their Work to Business Impact.
        2.  Set Clear Goals and Celebrate Wins.
        3.  Invest in Career Growth
        4. Create a Safe Space for Innovation
        5. Reward and Recoginzation

   q4 : How I Do Performance Reviews
        “I conduct performance reviews by aligning individual goals with team and company objectives,
        and using a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback.
        1. Goal Alignment & Tracking:
          At the beginning of each quarter, I work with each team member to set SMART goals like post defect eakag, release cycle ,test efficiency,
           mentoring juniors, or taking ownership of a module.End of each month do the tarck performance of indivual
        2. 360 degree feedback and peer feedback :
             I collect 360° feedback from peers, developers, and product managers. I also ask team members to submit a self-review
              reflecting on their impact, collaboration, and areas of growth.
        3. Evaluation/growth plan:
          In the actual review, I evaluate against performance criteria like quality of work,
          ownership, initiative, team collaboration, and technical growth

   Q5.  How do you build a strong QA culture within engineering?

        Building a strong QA culture within engineering means embedding quality into
        every phase of the software development lifecycle
        1. I promote the mindset that quality isn't only QA job , its shared across developer,product and operation.
        2. Embedded QA early in development cycle.
        3  Strong unified and Scable automation Framework and CI/CD Integration.
        4.  Define and Track Quality Metrics -
                    Metrics like defect leakage, automation coverage, escaped bugs, test pass rate,
                    and flaky test index are tracked.

                   Dashboards are reviewed in retros and monthly QA reviews with the whole engineering org.
        5.  Foster a Culture of Collaboration and Trust between QA nad dev - tarined basic Dev skils like debugging  , Code review
        6.  Upskill Continuously and Recognize Impactc


Q7.Test Strategy vs Test Approach

        Test Strategy is a high-level, organizational-level document that defines the overall testing objectives,
        standards, and methods to ensure product quality across the organization or a project. It is typically prepared by senior management (like the QA Manager or Test Manager) and remains relatively stable throughout the product lifecycle.

        It answers what types of testing will be done (functional, performance, security, etc.).

        It defines quality standards, test levels, entry/exit criteria, test environment needs, and risk management.

        It ensures that all projects within the organization align with common testing principles.

        ✅ Key focus: "What to test and why."

        Test Approach, on the other hand, is a detailed, project-specific plan describing how testing will be
        carried out for a particular project, sprint, release, or feature.
        It is usually created by the Test Lead or Senior QA Engineer and can change based on project risks, timelines, or priorities.

        It defines testing techniques, tools to be used, test prioritization, test data requirements, and specific deliverables.

        It describes how testing will be performed within the boundaries set by the Test Strategy.

        It is dynamic and can adapt as project conditions change.

        ✅ Key focus: "How to test and when."
